#TrustAd is an innovative advertising model🤩 that delivers personalised advertisements directly to users' devices without compromising privacy #by keeping all data processing and storage local ☑. Unlike traditional advertising systems that send browsing history and personal data to #remote servers📲, TrustAd processes all data on the client side, ensuring that sensitive information never leaves the user's device. This #approach eliminates the risk of data breaches and unauthorised access, providing a secure and private browsing experience🔒. 

#Challenges we ran into🧐:
#1. Targeted Advertising Without Sensitive Data: The primary challenge for TrustAd is to deliver targeted advertisements without collecting or #using sensitive user data 💯 . Developing Privacy-Preserving Algorithms, creating algorithms that can analyze user behaviour and preferences #without directly accessing personal data. 
#2. Anonymization and Data Masking 📵 : Applying anonymization and data masking techniques to ensure that any data used for ad targeting cannot #be traced back to individual users.
#3. Maintaining Secure and Bug-Free Servers: Ensuring that the server infrastructure is robust, secure, and free from vulnerabilities is crucial❗.
#Regular Security Audits, Conducting regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities. 
#4. Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts 📲: Implementing real-time monitoring systems to detect and respond to security threats immediately. 
#5. User Trust and Transparency: Building and maintaining user trust through transparency and clear communication about data usage policies. This #involves. Providing clear and understandable privacy policies that explain how user data is handled and protected.
